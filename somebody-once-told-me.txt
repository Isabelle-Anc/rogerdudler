Somebody once told me that if I did FRC
I could use the sharpest tools in the shed
It was late in the offseason but there wasn’t any reason
Not to join, they just said “go ahead”

Well, the meetings start coming and they don’t stop coming
When Kickoff came we hit the ground running
Told myself that I joined for fun
But it was so hard when I felt so dumb
So much to learn, so much to see
We’re student-built and it’s never easy
You can’t push ‘till you commit
Then maybe you’ll understand Git

Hey now, it’s midseason, at SFR, let’s play
Hey now, we’re the eighth seed, I think we’re done, today
And as soon as our match is done
It’s back to the pits we run

It’s a crazy place, in the I-Lab we’re working
Think it’s crunch time now, just wait ‘till we’re seniors
But the programming team begs to differ
Judging by the glor.io on their computers
We kicked some bot, but we’re here to win
When the water game comes we might as well swim
Our bot’s on fire, how ‘bout yours?
We like the magic smoke from the circuit board

Hey now, it’s midseason, at SVR, let’s play
Hey now, we’re the eighth seed, I think we’re done, today
And as soon as our match is done
It’s back to the pits we run

*instrumental*

Hey now, it’s midseason, at SVR, let’s play
Hey now, we’re the eighth seed, I think we’re done, today
And we’re the captains this time
It’s 4904 versus the world

Somebody once asked “could you spare some safety glasses
I need to drill some holes in a sketchy place”
I said “yes, what a concept, we’re not all immune to blasts
And we could all be a little more safe”

Well, the meetings start coming and they don’t stop coming
When the new members came we hit the ground running
I told the freshies to “come join, it’s fun
And don’t worry ‘bout sounding dumb”
What’s the new game? We’ll have to see
We’re headed into deep space and it won’t be easy
You can’t push ‘till you commit
Then maybe you’ll understand Git

Hey now, it’s offseason, we’re off to Calgames, let’s play
Hey now, we aren’t the eighth seed, and now we’re done, today
And as soon as our match is done
It’s back to the pit we run

And now that our season is done
It’s back to the I-Lab we run
